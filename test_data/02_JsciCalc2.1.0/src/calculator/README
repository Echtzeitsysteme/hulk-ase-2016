Java Scientific Calculator
==========================

To compile this application/applet you will need Sun Java 2 1.5.0 or an equivalent
Java compiler. You cannot use Java 1.4.x or earlier.

You should have within this directory, three subdirectories: button, pobject and
icons: icon contains some image files. The other two subdirectories contain some of
the java source and must be compiled.

I recommend you compile the application outside of the source tree. I use a
subdirectory called build and compile with the source in the jscical
subdirectory as follows. The instructions are for a unix system.

First set up build directory.

$ jar xvf jscicalc.jar
$ mkdir build
$ mkdir build/jscicalc
$ cp jscicalc/jar_cmf build/jscicalc/
$ mkdir build/jscicalc/icons
$ cp jscicalc/icons/* build/jscicalc/icons

Then compile class files.

$ javac -d build/ jscicalc/*.java
$ javac -d build/ jscicalc/button/*.java
$ javac -d build/ jscicalc/pobject/*.java

Then create jar file to contain them.

$ cd build
$ jar cmvf jscicalc/jar_cmf calculator.jar jscicalc/

Now you can place calculator.jar wherever you like and run it using

$ java -jar calculator.jar

Creating documentation
======================

You'll probably want to do this if you want to modify or embed the calculator in
something else.

First set up documentation directory.

$ cd .. (one level below jscical)
$ mkdir doc
$ mkdir doc/jscical
$ cp jscicalc/Doxyfile doc/jscicalc/

Create documentation using Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).

$ cd doc/jscicalc
$ doxygen

The documentation gets created in subdirectories, notably the HTML subdirectory.

Alternatively, you should can use javadoc.
