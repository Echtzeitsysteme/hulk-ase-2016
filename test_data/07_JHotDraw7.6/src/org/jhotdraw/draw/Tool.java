/**
 * A tool defines a mode of the drawing view. All input events targeted to the
 * drawing view are forwarded to its current tool.
 * <p>
 * Tools inform listeners when they are done with an interaction by calling
 * the ToolListener's toolDone() method. The Tools are created once and reused.
 * They are initialized/deinitialized with activate()/deactivate().
 * <p>
 * Tools are used for user interaction. Unlike figures, a tool works with
 * the user interface coordinates of the DrawingView. The user interface 
 * coordinates are expressed in integer pixels.
