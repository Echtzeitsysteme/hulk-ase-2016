This is a patched version of NanoXML which is made to be compilable with Java
1.5 and to take advantage of the Java2 Collections API. 
<p>
NanoXML has been changed to not open a network connection to retrieve the DTD of
a document. This greatly reduces the time needed to read an XML document. Also
Applets can't read DTD's which are not located on the same URL path as the
Applet's document base.
