# HULK - Continuous Design Flaw Detection

TODO: Here comes the abstract

HULK is a tool prototype to support object-oriented software development by continuously detecting design flaws over the version history. As a result, an annotated model of the program containing design flaw information is created. Moreover, the annotations also appear in the source code, effectively supporting maintenance decisions.

## Evaluation

We evaluate HULK on an established corpus of 16 (TODO: check) open-source Java projects selected from related literature on anti-pattern and code smell detection. Sources for the corpus are:
